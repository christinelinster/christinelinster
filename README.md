# 👋 Hi, I’m Christine

I’m a software engineer with 4+ years of experience as a leader in tech strategy, partnerships, and product development within the B2B SaaS space.
Before engineering, I worked at the intersection of business, product, and technology. I helping bring ideas to market — leading engineering teams, collaborating with C-level executives, and aligning solutions to real business outcomes.

That experience now shapes how I build: 
with a focus on technical excellence, scalability, and business impact.

## ⚙️ Technical Focus

I develop full-stack applications that merge technical depth with business insight, ensuring solutions are built with scalability, clarity, and purpose in mind.
Recently, I built a full-stack travel planning app with Python, Flask, Jinja templates, psycopg2, and PostgreSQL, hosted on Render. I love to learn and explore possibilities to integrate AI technologies.

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| Languages & Frameworks | Python, JavaScript, Flask, Node.js, Express.js, React, SQL, HTML/CSS |
| Database & APIs| PostgreSQL, RESTful API Design, CRUD Operations |
| Tools & Platforms | Git, GitHub, Render, Vercel, Postman|
| Software Practices | Object-Oriented Programming, Testing, Agile Development, Sprint Planning (JIRA)  |
| Other | Figma, Wordpress, JIRA, Hubspot, Go-to-Market Strategy |
