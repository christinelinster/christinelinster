# Hi, I'm Christine 👋
I'm an aspiring software developer with a background in tech and product strategy — now focusing on backend development, systems thinking, and full-stack projects.

I've been quietly learning and building since 2023 — and in 2025, I committed to learning and creating publicly.

🔧 Current Focus:
- Building with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- Deepening backend skills and system design knowledge
- Practicing data structures and algorithms in Python

🚀 Recent Project: [Task Trackr](https://task-trackr-auth.vercel.app/) (WIP)

🤝 Always learning. Always building. Always growing.
