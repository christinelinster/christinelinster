# ✨ Hi, I’m Christine

I’m a software engineer with 4+ years of experience as a leader in tech strategy, partnerships, and product development within the B2B Retail SaaS space.
In my previous role as Oracle Practice Lead, I worked at the intersection of business, product, and technology, helping bring ideas to market. I led engineering teams, collaborated with C-level executives, and aligned solutions to real business outcomes.

That experience now shapes how I build: 
with a focus on technical excellence, scalability, and business impact.

## 🙇🏻‍♀️ Technical Focus

I develop full-stack applications that merge technical depth with business insight, building solutions with clarity and purpose. Recently, I created a travel planning app using Python, Flask, Jinja templates, psycopg2, and PostgreSQL, deployed on Render. Above all, I love bringing ideas to life; there's an endless list of projects I want to build and share with the world. I'm driven by curiosity, and you'll always find me exploring new technologies and expanding my skills.

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| Languages & Frameworks | Python, JavaScript, Flask, Node.js, Express.js, React, SQL, HTML/CSS |
| Database & APIs| PostgreSQL, RESTful API Design, CRUD Operations |
| Tools & Platforms | Git, GitHub, Render, Vercel, Postman|
| Software Practices | Object-Oriented Programming, Testing, Agile Development, Sprint Planning (JIRA)  |
| Other | Figma, Wordpress, JIRA, Hubspot, Go-to-Market Strategy |

## 📸 Outside of Code

When I'm not building software, you'll find me behind a camera capturing life's moments, in the gym (lifting since 2015), or coding late into the night with EDM keeping me company.

- **photography & videography**: my creative outlet for capturing moments and telling visual stories
- **fitness enthusiast**: lifting since 2015, training others to build strength and confidence along the way
- **music lover**: EDM fuels my late-night coding sessions and keeps me in the flow state
